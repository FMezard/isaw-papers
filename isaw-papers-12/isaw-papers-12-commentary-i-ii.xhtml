<h1>Part I: Restorations, confirmations, and corrections.</h1>

<p>The first part of our horoscope is missing, including any introductory information such as the name of the native, the date and place for which the horoscope was computed, the entire section devoted to the Sun, and nearly the whole section devoted to the Moon. Elsewhere some items of information are lost to holes, abrasion, and staining, or only partially legible, and what <i>can</i> be read may sometimes be affected by errors committed by the copyist or the original composer of the horoscope. Fortunately large parts of the text follow a repetitive formulaic structure, some missing data can be deduced from astronomical considerations, and most of the astrological data were derived from the astronomical data according to identifiable rules that can be put into reverse. The first part of our commentary is primarily concerned with restoring and, where necessary, correcting the data relating to the longitudes of the heavenly bodies and astrologically significant points; and the date, time, and geographical locality of the nativity. Further discussion of the astronomical and astrological data in their own right will follow in parts II and III respectively.</p>

<p>The longitudes were expressed as zodiacal sign, degrees, and minutes. The other information in the horoscope derived from the longitudes included the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>The house ruler. This was one of the Sun, Moon, and five planets, according to a recognized scheme that assigned one complete zodiacal sign to each of the Sun and Moon, and two to each of the planets. Thus knowing the house ruler identifies the sign itself either uniquely or as one of a pair. Our horoscope is very reliable with respect to house rulers.</li>

<li>The terms ruler. Terms (ὅρια, literally, "boundaries") were subdivisions of irregular length of the zodiacal signs, each having one of the five planets as its ruler. Our horoscope reliably follows the so-called Egyptian system of terms, which was by far the most commonly used of the several attested systems and which is completely known from multiple sources. If the zodiacal sign is known, knowing the terms ruler narrows the longitude to a range of degrees within the sign.</li>

<li>The <i>monomoiria</i>. Each degree of a zodiacal sign was assigned to one of the seven heavenly bodies according to the following scheme. The first degree had the same ruler as the sign taken as a whole, while the rulers of the subsequent degrees cycled through the standard, so-called Chaldean order Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. Thus if the zodiacal sign is known, knowing the <i>monomoiria</i> limits the longitude to a set of four or five single degrees spread out at intervals of seven degrees. Our horoscope is usually reliable with respect to <i>monomoiriai</i>, but there is one clear instance of error.</li>

<li>The triplicity (or trigon). Each set of three zodiacal signs at intervals of four signs forms a triplicity, ruled by one of the seven heavenly bodies for diurnal nativities and another for nocturnal. Since the rulers given for the triplicities in our horoscope frequently conflict with the standard system, we have not made use of this information to establish or confirm the zodiacal signs.</li>

<li>The <i>dodekatemorion</i>. This is a variety of scheme that associates either twelve or thirteen equal divisions of each sign of the zodiac with one of the zodiacal signs. The particular scheme used in our horoscope, as we infer from the data, takes the degrees of the longitude, disregarding the minutes, multiplies by thirteen, and counts the product from the beginning of the zodiacal sign to find the sign of the <i>dodekatemorion</i>. The <i>dodekatemoria</i> appear to have been consistently computed correctly.</li>

<li>Exaltations and depressions. Each of the seven heavenly bodies has its exaltation in one zodiacal sign, and its depression in the diametrically opposite sign, according to a standardized system. Knowledge that a sign is the exaltation or depression of a particular body determines the sign. In our horoscope this information is reliable.</li>

<li>Nearby fixed star. The bottom register of each column of the horoscope's first part names a star that is close to the heavenly body. If the star is identifiable, it determines the body's longitude within a few degrees.</li>

<li>Lots. Lots are astrologically significant longitudes equal to a sum or difference involving the ascendant and some subset of the longitudes of the heavenly bodies. Our horoscope presents a system of seven lots whose formulas are given by Paulus Alexandrinus. The lots determine precise relations among the longitudes. The computations of lots in our horoscope have apparently been carried out carefully.</li>

</ul>

<p>The papyrus preserves complete statements of the longitudes of Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, the ascendant, and the ascending and descending nodes. Saturn's zodiacal sign can be deduced to be Aries, which together with Scorpio has Mars as its house ruler and which is the exaltation of the Sun and depression of Saturn. The Moon must be within a few degrees of its mean longitude, given as Cancer 24° 3', and the Sun within thirty degrees of Mercury and within sixty degrees of Venus, say between Scorpio 15° and Sagittarius 30°. Hence we have the following "low precision" data for establishing the date of the horoscope:</p>

<p>With the Sun in Scorpio or Sagittarius and the ascendant in Virgo, this is obviously a nocturnal nativity. We can narrow down the possible dates using the usual strategy for simple undated horoscopes, beginning with the combination of Saturn's and Jupiter's positions.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-1" href="#footnote-commi-ii-1">1</a></sup> Limiting consideration on the basis of the papyrus's paleography to years between 200 and 500 CE, and allowing generous margins beyond the sign boundaries, the combination Saturn in Aries, Jupiter in Virgo would be possible for the following years:<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-2" href="#footnote-commi-ii-2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>201-202, 260-261, 319-321, 379-380, 438-439, 497-498</p>

<p class="textindent0">For each of these years, we inspect the longitudes of Mars and the ascending node on November 20, around the middle of the span of less than two months possible for the Sun. In a single month Mars cannot move an entire sign, while the Moon's nodes shift by less than two degrees. </p>

<p>Since we are not testing for very precise agreement, we have used the theories of Ptolemy's <i>Almagest</i> to test each of the listed years because of the convenience of Robert van Gent's <i>Almagest Ephemeris Calculator</i> for making such comparisons.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-3" href="#footnote-commi-ii-3">3</a></sup> Only for 319 do we find a satisfactory match for both Mars and the node. Taking into account the signs occupied by Venus, Mercury, and the Moon, we can narrow the possible dates down to November 17-19.</p>

<p>To obtain further precision, we exploit the formulas for calculating the Lot of Fortune λ<sub>Fortune</sub> and the Lot of Daimon λ<sub>Daimon</sub> from the longitudes of the ascendant (λ<sub>H</sub>), the Sun (λ<sub>☉</sub>), and the Moon (λ<sub>☾</sub>) for a nocturnal nativity:</p>

<p>λ<sub>Fortune</sub> = λ<sub>H</sub> + λ<sub>☉</sub> – λ<sub>☾</sub></p>

<p>λ<sub>Daimon</sub> = λ<sub>H</sub> + λ<sub>☾</sub> – λ<sub>☉</sub></p>

<p>This gives us the elongation of the Moon from the Sun, (λ<sub>☾</sub> – λ<sub>☉</sub>), as 241° 22', while incidentally securing the uncertainly read numeral for the degrees of the Lot of Fortune. According to the <i>Almagest</i> theories, this elongation was attained, to the nearest equinoctial hour, on November 19 at about two equinoctial hours after midnight for the meridian of Alexandria. For this date and time, we compare data computed by the theories of the <i>Almagest</i> with the papyrus (Table 1).</p>

<p>Table 1. Astronomical data computed from Ptolemy's <i>Almagest</i> for 319 CE, November 19, 2 equinoctial hours after midnight (meridian of Alexandria, mean time according to the Era Nabonassar) compared with data from P.Berl. 9825.</p>

<p>Further refinements and corrections are possible. Saturn's <i>dodekatemorion</i> is stated to be in Taurus; this could only be true for a longitude whose whole number part is 3° or 4°. The precise longitude can be determined as Aries 3° 43' from the formula for the Lot of Nemesis for a nocturnal nativity:</p>

<p>λ<sub>Nemesis</sub> = λ<sub>H</sub> + λ<sub>♄</sub> – λ<sub>Fortune</sub></p>

<p>In the case of Jupiter, the stated longitude, Virgo 7° 40', conflicts with Mercury as the terms ruler (valid in Virgo only for longitudes less than or equal to 6°) and with Jupiter as ruler of the <i>monomoiria</i> (valid for 3° + 7<i>i</i>&lt; λ ≤ 4° + 7<i>i</i>, <i>i</i> = 0, 1, 2, or 3). From the formula for the Lot of Victory for a nocturnal nativity,</p>

<p>λ<sub>Victory</sub> = λ<sub>H</sub> + λ<sub>Daimon</sub> – λ<sub>♃</sub></p>

<p class="P3"> </p>

<p class="textindent0">we find Jupiter's longitude as Virgo 3° 40', consistent with the other astrological data derived from the longitude. The figure 7° in the papyrus must be a copying error (zeta instead of gamma).</p>

<p>The Moon's <i>dodekatemorion</i> fell in Gemini, so that the whole number part of its longitude was either 26° or 27°. Even at the beginning of this range this would imply an equation greater than +1° 57' where the <i>Almagest</i> gives +1° 41', so we may assume that the longitude was not much greater than Cancer 26°.</p>

<p>The data provided for the preceding full Moon provide us with another check on the solar and lunar longitudes. According to the papyrus, the exact opposition took place on Hathyr 17 (November 14) at the 7th seasonal hour—undoubtedly of day, though the indication of this is illegible—with the Sun at Scorpio 20° 30' and the Moon at Taurus 20° 30'. Since the nativity was roughly four and a half days later, the Sun's longitude at the nativity should have been within a few minutes of Scorpio 25° 0', and (adding the known elongation) the Moon's should have been within a few minutes of Cancer 26° 22'.</p>

<p>With an approximate value for the Sun's longitude, we can use the ascendant to get a more accurate estimate of the time of the nativity as well as the terrestrial latitude for which the horoscope was computed, on the hypotheses that the time was a whole number of seasonal hours past sunset and that trigonometrical tables comparable to Ptolemy's were used to determine the cardines. For a chosen latitude, we find the oblique ascensions of the ascendant (ρ<sub>H</sub>) and of the point diametrically opposite the Sun (ρ<sub>180°–</sub><sub>☉</sub>) as well as the number of degrees of ascension corresponding to one seasonal hour of night (χ). The ascensional difference divided by χ gives the number of seasonal hours past midnight corresponding to the ascendant for the chosen latitude; if it is close to an integer, this is likely to be the correct latitude.</p>

<p class="P5">Table 2. Time in seasonal hours corresponding to the known longitudes of the ascendant and Sun for principal latitudes of Ptolemy's geographical system.</p>

<p>From the oblique ascension tables of the <i>Handy Tables</i> we find the data given in Table 2.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-4" href="#footnote-commi-ii-4">4</a></sup> The circumstance that the calculations for the latitude of Syene lead to <i>exactly </i>7 seasonal hours strongly suggests that we have reconstructed the basis on which the ascendant was computed. This result implies (1) that the assumed time and place of the nativity were 319 November 19, end of the 7th hour of night, on the parallel through Syene, (2) that the ascension tables were essentially the same as those of the <i>Handy Tables</i>, and (3) that the longitude of the Sun was assumed to be exactly Scorpio 25° 0', either because this was the actual longitude calculated for the date or because the longitude was close enough to a whole number that the computer did not bother to interpolate in the table but merely read of the tabulated value for the nearest whole degree. (If we take the Sun's stated longitude at the preceding full Moon and add the Sun's progress between that moment and that of the nativity according to the <i>Almagest</i>, we get approximately Scorpio 25° 8'.)</p>

<p>According to the table of right ascensions of the <i>Handy Tables</i>, the midheaven corresponding to ρ<sub>H</sub> = 159° 5' is Gemini 10° 44'. Unfortunately all that one can be sure of from the papyrus is that the whole number part of the midheaven's longitude was 10° or greater, and that the number of minutes had two digits.</p>

<h1>Part II: Astronomical commentary.</h1>

<p>For purposes of comparison with modern theory, we assume (disregarding the effect of the equation of time) that times according to our horoscope as well as according to the <i>Almagest</i> theories are two equinoctial hours later than UT. The time of the nativity derived above is approximately 1.1 equinoctial hours past midnight, and the horoscope's time for the preceding full Moon is approximately 0.9 equinoctial hours past noon. The longitudinal data present in the papyrus or securely restored are compared below with computations for the same dates and times according to the <i>Almagest</i> and according to the modern theory.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-5" href="#footnote-commi-ii-5">5</a></sup> The errors with respect to the JPL figures are in parentheses.</p>

<p>Table 4. Comparison of papyrus horoscope with data from Ptolemy's <i>Almagest</i> and modern theory (JPL Horizons ephemeris).</p>

<p>It is immediately obvious that the longitudes in the papyrus were not obtained from Ptolemy's tables, but from some other source of roughly equivalent accuracy. Considering only the five planets, the mean error for the papyrus is –25', with a standard deviation of 35'; the <i>Almagest</i> mean error is –1° 49', with standard deviation 39'. The mean error of Ptolemy's longitudes is largely due to his defective tropical frame of reference, which is about a degree off for his own time and by the date of the horoscope about a degree and a half off.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-6" href="#footnote-commi-ii-6">6</a></sup> If, as we incline to believe, the longitudes of the horoscope are to be understood as tropical, the planetary tables on which it was based seem to have reflected little error in the frame of reference. On the other hand, the tables for the Sun and Moon appear to have had similar systematic errors to Ptolemy's. Perhaps the composer of the horoscope used tables from different sources for the luminaries and for the planets.</p>

<p>An alternative possibility worth exploring is that the longitudes in the horoscope are in a sidereal frame of reference. Abundant evidence exists that when Ptolemy's tables were used for astrological purposes during the third and fourth centuries, the tropical longitudes obtained from the tables were generally converted to sidereal by adding 8° minus one-eightieth of a degree for every year since 158 BCE, a formula explicitly reported by Theon of Alexandria as employed by the "astrologers of old."<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-7" href="#footnote-commi-ii-7">7</a></sup> For the nativity date, the value of this correction would have been approximately +2° 3', an amount that would more or less cancel out the error of Ptolemy's tropical frame of reference. It is conceivable, therefore, that the planetary longitudes in the papyrus look like tropical longitudes in an accurate tropical frame of reference because they are actually sidereal longitudes in a frame of reference that by chance nearly coincided with the true tropical frame of reference in the early fourth century. This hypothesis fails, however, to explain why the longitudes for the Sun and Moon appear to fit Ptolemy's inaccurate tropical frame of reference, and moreover our reconstructed computation of the ascendant assumes that the solar longitude was understood as tropical.</p>

<p>The synchronization of the longitudinal theories of the Sun and Moon is crucial for obtaining accurate times of syzygy. According to the JPL ephemeris, the exact opposition on November 14 occurred less than 20 minutes before the time given in the papyrus, which of course is expressed just as a whole number of seasonal hours; the <i>Almagest</i> theories predict exact opposition about 20 minutes later than the papyrus.</p>

<p>A puzzling item in the horoscope is the longitude given for the "latitude (πλάτοϲ) of the Moon," Capricorn 18° 3'. Obviously this is not a latitude at all, nor does it have any recognizable relation to the Moon's argument of latitude (167° 20' from the northern limit according to the <i>Almagest</i>) or the nodes. We suspect that it represents the longitude of the apogee in an eccentric lunar model. Modern theory puts the lunar apogee at Capricorn 27° 41', while according to the mean motions of the <i>Almagest</i>, this point (which has no direct role in Ptolemy's epicyclic model) would have been at Capricorn 25° 29' (error –2° 12'). Hence if our identification is correct, the error in the apogee (–9° 38') and the resulting phase error in lunar anomaly of the tables used for the horoscope were considerably greater than Ptolemy's. The incorrect designation of this position as the latitude could have resulted from eyeskip in copying a list of data relating to the Moon.</p>

<p>We pointed out previously that if the solar tables used for the horoscope gave the same increase in the Sun's longitude as the <i>Almagest</i> over the interval between the preceding full Moon and the nativity, the Sun's longitude at the nativity should have been about Scorpio 25° 8', and hence, adding the elongation 241° 22', the Moon's longitude should have been about Cancer 26° 30'. Subtracting the Moon's mean longitude, Cancer 24° 3', we find the Moon's equation to be about +2° 27'.</p>

<p>Now suppose that the lunar tables used by the horoscope's composer assumed a simple eccentric model, the eccentric counterpart of the preliminary epicyclic model of <i>Almagest</i> Book 4. Entering the Moon's argument of anomaly (i.e. the mean Moon minus the apogee), 186° 0', in the table of equations in Book 4 chapter 10, we find an equation of merely +35'. Obviously a simple model, even with a much larger eccentricity, could not have produced an equation of about two and a half degrees.</p>

<p>The final lunar model of <i>Almagest</i> Book 5, which accounts for the Moon's second anomaly by introducing a rapidly revolving eccenter bearing the epicycle, yields an equation of +1° 36' because Ptolemy's special definition of the apogee of the lunar epicycle introduces an adjustment (commonly called the <i>prosneusis</i> in modern discussions) to the argument of anomaly. This correction is dependent on the mean elongation of the Moon from the Sun. The equation, in turn, is dependent on this corrected argument of anomaly and on the mean elongation.</p>

<p>Suppose now that the tables used for the horoscope assumed a model that was functionally similar to Ptolemy's final model. We may assume that the mean elongation would have been very nearly the same as obtained from the <i>Almagest</i> theory, 238° 37', but,because of the greater phase error, the mean anomaly was 186° 0' instead of 178° 52'. The so-called<i>prosneusis</i> correction, +13° 9', is unchanged, so the corrected argument is 199° 9', and the equation is +2° 32'. Since this is quite close to the value we are looking for, it would appear that our conjecture is correct that the longitude Capricorn 18° 3' in the horoscope refers to the apogee in lunar model in which an eccenter accounted for the first anomaly, and moreover this model also incorporated a correction for the second anomaly in a way not dissimilar from Ptolemy's final model.</p>

<p>The middle register for the Moon and each of the planets contains a statement about the body's position and motion in latitude. It comprises three parts:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A location statement "in the ascent/descent of the south/north" (ἐπὶ τῆϲ τοῦ νοτίου/βορείου ἀναβάϲεωϲ/καταβάϲεωϲ). This is probably according to a division of the ecliptic into four quadrants delimited by nodes and northern and southern limits, so that the variables were determined purely by the body's longitude and the location of the nodes.</li>

<li>The latitude expressed in degrees and minutes in a stated direction south or north (ὡϲ πρὸϲ τὰϲ μεϲημβρίαϲ/ἄρκτουϲ) of the ecliptic. This would have been computed using tables based on a latitudinal model.</li>

<li>A qualitative statement about the latitude in the form "ascending/descending the south/north" (ἀναβαίνων/καταβαίνων τὰ νότια/βόρεια) or simply "ascending/descending." The trend was likely also determined from the latitudinal model, e.g. by comparing latitudes computed for consecutive days, while the direction, when given, simply repeats information from the second part using a different vocabulary.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Moon's descending node is given later in the papyrus as Taurus 9° 40', and, as we have seen, the Moon's own longitude was near Cancer 26° 30', so it would have been on the descending quadrant south of the ecliptic. If the maximum lunar latitude was assumed to be 5° (Ptolemy's parameter), an argument of latitude around 166° 50' would yield a latitude of –4° 52'. Only the whole number of the latitude, 4°, and the indication in the third part that the Moon is moving further south survive on the papyrus.</p>

<p>The latitudes and trends (represented by arrows, up meaning northward) ascribed to the planets in the horoscope are summarized below, with comparisons from Ptolemy's <i>Almagest</i> and <i>Handy Tables</i> and from modern theory.</p>

<p>Table 5. Latitudinal data for planets from papyrus horoscope and Ptolemy's <i>Almagest</i> compared.</p>

<p>Saturn was in fact near its southern limit, so that a modest shift in its assumed nodal line would explain why the papyrus has its latitude decreasing, but the indication that it was north of the ecliptic is surely a mistake rather than a reflection of a variant latitudinal model. Similarly Jupiter was close enough to its northern limit so that its computed trend would have been sensitive to the exact placement of the nodal line. In any case, it is obvious that the latitudinal models underlying the data in the papyrus were significantly different from either those of the <i>Almagest</i> or the revised models of the <i>Handy Tables</i>.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-8" href="#footnote-commi-ii-8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>The lowest register identifies a fixed star that "rises with" the heavenly body. These turn out to be stars in the zodiacal belt, and the principle of their selection seems to have been proximity in longitude, not in oblique ascension; in other words, the composer of the horoscope simply consulted a star catalogue, paying attention only to the stars' longitudes. As we will see, the catalogue was similar or identical to the zodiacal star list in the <i>Handy Tables</i>. The text in the horoscope ("being north/south of the star") gives the impression that the stated number of degrees and minutes represents a difference in latitude between the star and the heavenly body, but comparison with the <i>Handy Tables</i> list shows that this quantity is simply the star's own latitude. Perhaps τοῦ ἀϲτέροϲ ("of the star") is a confused substitution for τοῦ διὰ μέϲων ("of the ecliptic"). βαθμόϲ, "step," as a quasi-unit for the stars' magnitudes (which again simply match Ptolemy's) has no parallel of which we are aware; it is unrelated to the use of βαθμόϲ for a unit of argument of latiude (equivalent to 15°).<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-9" href="#footnote-commi-ii-9">9</a></sup></p>

<p>The <i>Handy Tables</i> list is an adaptation from the catalogue of <i>Almagest</i> Books 7-8 but with many variants in the names assigned to the stars.Instead of absolute longitudes for a specific epoch date, the list gives each star's elongation from Regulus (obtained by subtracting Regulus's <i>Almagest</i> longitude, 122° 30', from the star's<i>Almagest</i> longitude). The stars are notgrouped according to the imaginary figures of the constellations,but in order of increasing elongation, which is convenient for finding which stars were closest to each heavenly body on a given date. In the absence of a critical edition of the list, we have consulted three early copies, <i>L</i> =<i>Leid. B.P.G.</i> 78 (ff. 142r-145r), <i>F</i> = <i>Laur. plut.</i> 28,26 (ff. 124v-127r), and <i>V</i> = <i>Vat. gr.</i> 1291 (ff. 90v-94v).<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-10" href="#footnote-commi-ii-10">10</a></sup></p>

<p>For each of the planets, we give the body's elongation from Regulus (subtracting the<i>Handy Tables</i>longitude of Regulus for the nativity date, Leo 4° 19' from the body's horoscope longitude). The star's name as given in the papyrus is followed by the form or forms of the name in the three <i>Handy Tables</i> manuscripts and the <i>Almagest</i>. References in the form "XXII: 1, PK 362, Heiberg 2.84-85" indicate the constellation and star number in Toomer's translation of the <i>Almagest</i> catalogue, the number assigned by Peters and Knobel (following Bailly), and the page numbers in Heiberg's edition.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-11" href="#footnote-commi-ii-11">11</a></sup> We also provide Toomer's and Graßhoff's identifications of the stars.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-12" href="#footnote-commi-ii-12">12</a></sup></p>

<p class="margintop15em">Despite the gaps in the papyrus, enough survives of the star's name to put its identity beyond reasonable doubt. At elongation 244° 10', it was not the closest star to Saturn in the <i>Handy Tables</i> list. The nearest star with a lower elongation is ὁ προηγούμενοϲ τοῦ ἐπὶ τοῦ ϲυνδέϲμου τῶν β̅  λίνων ("the one in advance of the one on the node of the two fishing-lines" = XXXIII: 18, PK 691, Heiberg 2.126-127), while the nearest with a higher elongation is ὁ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ τοῦ ϲυνδέϲμου τῶν β̅  <a id="_GoBack"/>λίνων λαμπρόϲ ("the bright one right on the node of the two fishing-lines" = XXXIII: 19, PK 692, Heiberg 2.126-127).<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-13" href="#footnote-commi-ii-13">13</a></sup>The star named in the papyrus comes immediately after this pair. Apparently either the list consulted by the composer of the horoscope was missing several stars that the <i>Handy Tables</i> list has in this region, or he made a mistake.</p>

<p class="textindent0 margintop15em">Jupiter. Elongation 29° 19'.</p>

<p class="margintop15em">Papyrus: ὁ ἑπόμενοϲτῆϲ νο[τί]α̣ϲ πτέρυγοϲ τῆϲ [Πα]ρ̣θ̣έ̣ν̣ο̣υ</p>

<p>Toomer, Graßhoff: β Vir</p>

<p class="textindent0 margintop15em">ἑπόμενοϲ ("trailing") in the papyrus was probably a misreading of ἐπ᾿ ἄκραϲ ("on the tip of"). The next star in the <i>Handy Tables</i> list (but further from Jupiter at elongation 35° 45') is ὁ ἑπόμενοϲ καὶ δεύτεροϲ ὢν νοτιώτεροϲ αὐτοῦ ("the trailing and second one, being south of it" = XXVII: 6, PK 502, Heiberg 2.102-103).<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-commi-ii-15" href="#footnote-commi-ii-15">15</a></sup></p>

<p class="textindent0 margintop15em">Mars. Elongation 108° 13'.</p>

<p>Elongation 102° 0', latitude +5° 30', magnitude 3</p>

<p>Toomer, Graßhoff: τ Sco</p>

<p class="textindent0 margintop15em">The papyrus agrees with <i>V</i>'s version of the name in not indicating that this is one of a set of three stars; the somewhat unstable presence of the number in <i>L</i> and <i>F</i> may reflect contamination from the <i>Almagest</i>. The next star in the <i>Handy Tables</i> list, ὁ ἐπὶ τοῦ ἑπομένου γόνατοϲ τοῦ Ὀφιούχου ("the one on the trailing knee of Ophiuchus" = XIII: 12, PK 245, Heiberg 2.68-69) had a greater longitude than Mars but was much closer to the planet, at elongation 108° 40'.</p>

<p class="textindent0 margintop15em">Venus. Elongation 84° 59'.</p>

<p class="margintop15em">Papyrus: ὁ ἐν μέϲῃ τῇ νοτίῳ χή̣λῃ τοῦ Ϲκορπίου</p>

<p><i>Almagest</i> (XXVIII: 5, PK 533, Heiberg 2.106-107): ὁ ἐν μέϲῃ τῇ νοτίῳ χηλῇ</p>

<p>Elongation 81° 30', latitude –1° 40', magnitude 4</p>

<p>Toomer: ι Lib; Graßhoff: ι<sup>1</sup> Lib</p>

<p class="textindent0 margintop15em">The next star in the <i>Handy Tables</i> list, ὁ ἐν μέϲῃ τῇ βορείᾳ χηλῇ τοῦ Ϲκορπίου ("the one on the middle of the northern claw of the Scorpion"), has elongation 85° 20' and thus was closer to Venus though higher in longitude.</p>

<p class="textindent0 margintop15em">Mercury. Elongation 129° 34'.</p>

<p class="margintop15em">Papyrus: ὁ βοριότεροϲ ἀ̣π̣ὸ̣ το̣ῦ̣ βοριοτάτου τῶν ἐν τῷ τ̣όξῳ</p>

<p><i>L</i>: Ο Β̅ ΑΥΤ(ΟΥ) ΒΟΡΙΩΤΑ(ΤΟΥ) Τ(ΩΝ) ΕΝ ΤΩ ΤΟΞΩ</p>

<p><i>Almagest</i> (XXX>: 4, PK 573, Heiberg 2.112-113): τῶν ἐν τῷ βορείῳ μέρει τοῦ τόξου ὁ νοτιώτεροϲ</p>

<p>Elongation 126° 30', latitude –1° 30', magnitude 3</p>

<p>Toomer, Graßhoff: λ Sgr</p>

<p class="textindent0 margintop15em">The reading of <i>L</i> shows the origin of the papyrus's βοριότεροϲ as a misinterpretation of the ordinal numeral beta as an abbreviation. The next star in the <i>Handy Tables</i> list, ὁ ἡγούμενοϲ τῶν ἐν τῷ ὠμοπλάτῃ τοῦ Τοξότου ("the trailing one of those on the shoulderblade of Sagittarius" = XXX: 7, PK 576, Heiberg 2.112-113), was closer to Mercury at elongation 130° 30'.</p>

<p>Thus with the sole exception of the star provided for Saturn, which was probably chosen in error, the star said to be "rising with" each planet is consistently the star in the <i>Handy Tables</i> list that was closest to it in the direction of lower longitude. If this was the case for the Moon (at elongation 352° 11'), the star ought to have been the following:</p>

<p class="textindent0 margintop15em"><i>Handy Tables</i> (<i>LF</i>): τῶν ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ τοῦ Λέοντοϲ β̅ ὁ νοτιώτεροϲ</p>

<p><i>V</i>: the relevant folio is missing</p>

<p><i>Almagest</i> (XXVI: 4, PK 465, Heiberg 2.98-99): ὁ νοτιώτεροϲ αὐτῶν (<i>scil.</i> τῶν ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ β̅)</p>

<p>Elongation 351° 40', latitude –9° 30', magnitude greater than 3</p>

<p>Toomer, Graßhoff: ε Leo</p>

<p class="textindent0 margintop15em">This reconstruction has tenuous support in the surviving numeral for the magnitude (which could have been qualified with "greater than" either before or on the next line); the preceding and following stars in the <i>Handy Tables</i> list respectively have magnitudes "less than 4" and "greater than 4."</p>
